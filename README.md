# valheimdiscordwebhook
A rudimentary (read: works, but coded poorly) powershell script that monitors Valheim's log file for login, logout and death events and pushes them to a discord webhook.

In order to use it, you need to modify the log file locations to reflect your server's log file location, and edit the webhookUri value to reflect the Discord channel webhook URL you want it to post to.
